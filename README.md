# LanguageStudy
I taken my courage to learn a new language about half a year ago.I don't konw what it will reward me but I do know what does it spend.
About three months ago,I started to learn python programmer language,I think python will help me study language well.Here I made a little 
python script to help me remember Japanese words and grammars.
